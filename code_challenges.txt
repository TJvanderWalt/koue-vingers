Coding challenges help you to become a "computational thinker" as stated in 
"The little book of programming challenges" 

At the same time, writing programs can be frustrating - if you get 
stuck don't give up!
# Use the internet for help (but not the answer!)
# Use the help features of the programming development environment.
# Use features like break points and variable watches to try to
work out what is happening if the program doesn’t seem to
work.
# Work with other students on the course— "two heads are better than one"

The book (find it on the internet!) poses 27 challenges: files little_1 through little_27 
contain Python code to address these challenges
